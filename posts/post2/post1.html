                        </h2>
                        <p>"This time is different," the seemingly ordinary four-word sentence, is weirdly considered by Templeton as the most dangerous saying from any investor. Templeton is no typical investor either; he was an exceptional visionary who revolutionized the investment landscape, as engraved in the name of the pioneering and prestigious global investment firm, Franklin Templeton Investments. So why did Templeton, such a respected and forward-thinking figure, view this phrase with such caution?</p>
                        <!-- <h3>Part 1: The Definition and Types of Risk That Exist</h3> -->
                        <p>Templeton has realized the pitfall of perception in which many investors are trapped—the inability to see beyond the circumstances. Throughout history, investors have been prone to thinking that the current market environment is unique. They often convince themselves that the rules of the game have changed, dismissing the lessons learned from previous cycles. This mentality stems from the natural human tendency to seek validation for our actions and decisions. However, this inclination can lead to costly mistakes and a disregard for the patterns and cycles that have shaped markets for decades. From the dot-com bubble to the housing crisis, although there are striking differences between the two periods, we will soon recognize the shocking similarities and patterns as we take a step back.</p>
                        <p>The 1980s and 1990s were known for the "tech craze" or the "dot-com boom." This period was characterized by a surge of enthusiasm and investment in technology-related companies, particularly those involved in the emerging field of the internet and information technology. Investors were drawn to tech companies due to the promise of disruptive technologies, new business models, and the potential for significant growth and profitability. The increasing popularity of personal computers, the rise of the internet, and the emergence of groundbreaking companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Intel, and Cisco Systems captured the imagination of investors and the public. The enthusiasm for tech stocks reached its peak in the late 1990s, when internet-based companies, often referred to as dot coms, experienced skyrocketing stock prices. Many of these companies were newly formed and lacked a solid business model or profits, yet they attracted substantial investments based on expectations of future success. This speculative bubble eventually burst in the early 2000s, leading to the dot-com bust, as many overvalued companies failed, resulting in significant market declines and investor losses.</p>
                        <p>Fast forward to the early 2000s, just after people thought the market couldn’t seem to worsen when a global housing crisis was on the horizon. This time, the focus shifted to the real estate market and the ensuing housing crisis of 2007–2008. The real estate market experienced a rapid expansion fueled by loose lending practices, low-interest rates, and a widespread belief that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Homeownership became increasingly accessible, and speculation in the housing market soared. Financial institutions, enticed by the seemingly endless growth potential, created complex financial products such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) to package and sell mortgage loans. These products were often bundled together, given high credit ratings, and sold to investors worldwide. However, beneath the surface, these securities were backed by risky subprime mortgages—loans granted to borrowers with poor creditworthiness. As the housing market started to show signs of strain with increasing defaults and foreclosures, the fragile foundation on which it stood began to crumble. The interconnectedness of financial institutions through the global financial system amplified the impact of the crisis. As subprime mortgage defaults surged, the value of mortgage-backed securities plummeted, causing significant losses for banks and other financial institutions.
                          The housing bubble burst, leading to a chain reaction of financial distress, widespread bank failures, and a severe credit crunch. The crisis unfolded on a global scale, affecting not only the United States but also economies worldwide. Stock markets plummeted, unemployment soared, and millions of homeowners faced foreclosure, resulting in a deep recession and prolonged economic downturn.
                          </p>
                        <p>In retrospect, it becomes evident that despite the seemingly distinct characteristics of the dot-com bubble and the housing crisis, there were underlying similarities. While the specific catalysts or triggers for each cycle may differ, the underlying human emotions and behavioral patterns remain remarkably consistent. Fear and greed, optimism and pessimism, and the pendulum swings between excessive optimism and excessive pessimism all play a role in shaping market behavior. </p>
                        <p>In the case of the dot-com bubble, companies have been considered valuable primarily because they produce profits—if not immediately, then at least they were expected to do so in the foreseeable future. Then the view arose in the tech, media, and telecom bubble of the late 1990s that companies could be great (and valuable) even in the absence of profits for years to come. The prevailing sentiment at the time was that traditional valuation metrics no longer mattered. It was believed that these new internet companies operated under entirely different rules and had the potential to disrupt entire industries. This perception, combined with the fear of missing out on the next big thing, fueled a speculative bubble of epic proportions. As prices continued to soar, there was an increasing disconnect between the valuations of these companies and their underlying fundamentals. While some internet companies ultimately became industry giants, many others were unable to deliver on their promises, leading to their demise. </p>
                        <p>Tech companies have matured and generated significant revenue since the bubble burst. Thus, there’s great interest in tech companies (including ones like Uber and Lyft that are applying technology to enable new business models) and a willingness to pay high prices today for the possibility of profits far down the road. There’s nothing wrong with this, as long as the possibility is real, not overrated, and not overpriced. The issue is that in a period when profitlessness isn’t an impediment to investor affection—when projected tech-company profitability commencing years from now is valued as highly as, or higher than, the current profits of more mundane firms—investing in these companies can be a big mistake.</p>
                        <p>As for the housing crisis, it was far more complicated and centered around the real estate market and the subprime mortgage industry, driven by a combination of factors, including lax lending standards, a housing price bubble, and the securitization of subprime mortgages. This time, it’s different, but not very different. Investors decided that, unlike the unambiguous and unsustainable nature of the tech companies arising from the start of the digital era, the housing market, fueled by rising demands, reliance on the government and regulatory oversight, and brilliant “financial innovations” aimed at controlling risks, couldn’t fail. And the result was a catastrophic housing crisis that had far-reaching implications. During the housing crisis, there was a widespread disregard for traditional metrics and risk assessment in the real estate market. One key metric that was often overlooked or downplayed was the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which measures the percentage of a property's value that is financed through a mortgage. In the years leading up to the crisis, lenders increasingly offered high LTV loans, sometimes even exceeding the full value of the property. This meant that borrowers had little to no equity in their homes, making them highly susceptible to price declines.</p>
                        <p>Another metric that was disregarded was the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, which compares a borrower's monthly debt payments to their monthly income. As lending standards relaxed, many borrowers were allowed to take on excessive debt relative to their income levels. This created a precarious situation where borrowers were more vulnerable to financial difficulties or default if their income couldn't support their debt obligations.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, traditional appraisal methods and valuation metrics were often overridden or manipulated. Appraisers were put under pressure to inflate property values to support the high loan amounts being issued. This created an artificial sense of value in the housing market and contributed to bubble-like conditions.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the disregard for traditional metrics and risk assessment in the housing market during the crisis played a significant role in the subsequent collapse. When housing prices started to decline and borrowers began to default on their mortgages, the weaknesses in the system were exposed, leading to a domino effect that reverberated throughout the financial system and the broader economy.</p>
                        <p>Leading up to the crisis, there was a widespread belief that housing prices would continue to rise indefinitely, fueling a disregard for the fundamental analysis of the underlying assets. Financial institutions and market participants who stood to profit from the continued expansion of the housing market further perpetuated this mindset. This in turn resulted in the widespread belief that the demand for housing would always outpace supply due to population growth, immigration, and cultural aspirations for homeownership. This assumption led to the assumption that housing prices would continue to rise, making it a safe investment. In investing, however, the truth usually lies somewhere between the extremes of infinite value and worthlessness. Investor sentiment seems to be closer to the positive end of the pendulum’s arc these days, but it’s unlikely to stay there in perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>Innovation and reinvention can give rise to bubbles that eventually burst. Although recessions may come and hopefully go, the foundation of the market, though shaken, will endure. Likewise, investments should remain steadfast if they were carefully researched and selected based on the strength of the underlying businesses and competent management. These businesses, when confronted with market volatility, will not only adapt as needed but also stay committed to their long-term strategies. And so should investors.</p>
